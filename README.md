## News app

*Just for fun:* In one evening I followed along to an easy tutorial I found on Twitter from [Smashing Magazine][smash-mag], to create my own news feed application.

Built with Angular CLI, Google's Material Design language, and [News API][news-api] - a JSON api that retrieves live news articles. Get the Github repo [here][tutorial-repo], to make your own.
